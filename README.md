# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:


# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `AlphaShare.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
